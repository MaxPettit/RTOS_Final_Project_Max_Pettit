# RTOS Final Project Max Pettit
Final Update: Includes 2 Segger Systemview screenshots. Includes separate analysis of solution document. Final code in zip form. Unit tests within project. Configuration data struct in physics.c, if user changes configuration data it is suggested to turn off unit tests by setting run_all bool to false (some tests compare values against defualt ranges and may fail).

Week 5: Updated task diagram. Included a screenshot of Segger view of project. Game is nearly finished, just need add configurability so it takes in input for config parameters.

Week 4: Unit test files are part of project code and also included separately. Code in zip format. Game should be playable though not finished. All risks resolved or accepted.

Week 3: Code also as sls file, these files are supposedly easy to updload to simplicity studio but I'll do zip's from now on.

Week 2: First code upload. Code added as a .sls file

Each week has its own directory.
Within each week there is at least the following:
  - One pdf and word document containing unit testing
  - One pdf and word document containing the Project Standing _and_ Scoped Work
  - One spreadsheet for the risk register
