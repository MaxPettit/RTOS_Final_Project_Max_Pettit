# RTOS Final Project Max Pettit

Week 4: Unit test files are part of project code and also included separately. Code in zip format. Game should be playable though not finished. All risks resolved or accepted.

Week 3: Code also as sls file, these files are supposedly easy to updload to simplicity studio but I'll do zip's from now on.

Week 2: First code upload. Code added as a .sls file

Each week has its own directory.
Within each week there is at least the following:
  - One pdf and word document containing unit testing
  - One pdf and word document containing the Project Standing _and_ Scoped Work
  - One spreadsheet for the risk register
